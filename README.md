# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection and Classification using Deep Learning (DCNN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based system for detecting and classifying plant leaf diseases. The model analyzes leaf images and predicts the disease category, helping farmers and researchers take early action.

The application is deployed using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing users to upload leaf images and get instant predictions.
